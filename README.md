# Clinic Appointment Scheduling System

This Laravel-based web application is designed to manage clinic appointment scheduling for enrollment of new students. It aims to solve the long queues and inefficiencies of the traditional first-come, first-serve clinic system used during enrollment.

The system allows students to book appointments online, while clinic staff can monitor, approve, and manage daily appointment schedules efficiently. It supports role-based access for both admin and students, status-based appointment tracking, and includes backend scripts for maintenance and system health monitoring.
